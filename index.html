                <p>Pallan worked in the travel business as well as working for the family business offshoot called Watermaker India. This company hosts the technology to create drinking water from the humidity in the air. Governments would buy the product for villages in India. This saves lives and helps stop the women from having to carry the water in large pots on their heads.</p>
